### Tab Completion

- `/ezeconomy` now supports professional tab completion for all subcommands and database actions.
- Suggestions are context-aware and permission-sensitive.

### Tips

- Use a permissions plugin to control which groups can access administrative commands.
- For multi-currency servers, `/currency` controls each player’s preferred display currency.

## Pay All (`/pay *`)

Using `/pay * <amount>` sends the specified amount to multiple recipients at once. This feature is configurable and permission-gated.

- **Default behavior:** Targets online players only.
- **Config keys:**
	- `pay.pay_all.enabled` (boolean, default: `true`) — enable/disable the pay-all feature.
	- `pay.pay_all.require_permission` (boolean, default: `true`) — require `ezeconomy.payall` to use `/pay *`.
	- `pay.pay_all.include_offline` (boolean, default: `false`) — when `true`, include stored offline players (server storage) in the recipient list; when `false` only currently online players are paid.
- **Permissions:**
	- `ezeconomy.pay` — standard pay permission for `/pay <player>`.
	- `ezeconomy.payall` — (optional) grant access to `/pay *` when `pay.pay_all.require_permission` is `true`.
	- `ezeconomy.payall.bypasswithdraw` — optional permission that lets the command credit recipients without withdrawing the total from the sender (useful for admin/gift operations).
- **Behavior notes:**
	- Unless `bypasswithdraw` is granted, the sender is charged the total amount (amount × recipients) before recipients are credited; failure to withdraw aborts the operation.
	- Recipients are credited in their preferred currency (conversion applied where needed).
	- By default the command enumerates online players via the server; enabling `pay.pay_all.include_offline` uses the storage provider to enumerate stored balances and may include offline-only accounts.
	- A summary message (`paid_all_summary`) is sent to the sender after successful execution. Recipients receive the standard payment notification if they are online.
	- Large recipient sets or mixed-currency conversions may increase execution time; consider enabling the feature only for trusted admins and ensure backup/monitoring is in place.
	- On Velocity networks with `cross-server.enabled: true`, `/pay *` includes players from all backend servers. Each remote recipient receives a notification forwarded through the proxy.
