## 🔒 Security Notes for Server Owners

- **Limit admin permissions**: Only grant `ezeconomy.eco` and `ezeconomy.bank.admin` to trusted staff.
- **Use a permissions plugin**: Manage access with groups/roles so players cannot self-assign economy powers.
- **Lock down database access**: Use a dedicated database user with minimal privileges and keep credentials private.
- **Back up economy data**: Schedule regular backups of your storage files or database to recover from mistakes or exploits.
- **Review bank permissions**: Consider limiting bank creation/withdraw permissions to prevent abuse on public servers.

## 🛡️ Dupe Prevention Safeguards

- **Thread-safe balance updates**: Economy operations are designed to avoid race conditions during concurrent deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- **Server-side validation**: Commands and transactions validate amounts to prevent invalid or malformed requests.
- **Storage integrity**: Backends use consistent write patterns to reduce the risk of partial or conflicting balance writes.

## 🔗 Integration

- EzEconomy automatically registers as a Vault provider
- No extra setup required for Vault-compatible plugins
- **PlaceholderAPI support**:
  - Use placeholders in chat, scoreboard, and other plugins:
    - `%ezeconomy_balance%` – Your balance
    - `%ezeconomy_balance_<currency>%` – Your balance in a specific currency (e.g., `%ezeconomy_balance_euro%`)
    - `%ezeconomy_bank_<bank>%` – Balance of a specific bank
    - `%ezeconomy_top_1%` – Top 1 player balance (replace 1 with rank)
    - `%ezeconomy_currency%` – Your preferred currency
  - Works with all PlaceholderAPI-compatible plugins

## 🛠️ Developer: Custom Storage Providers

EzEconomy supports custom storage backends (YML, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, or your own). You can implement your own provider for any database or storage system.

**How to add a custom provider:**

1. Implement the `StorageProvider` interface in your plugin or module.
2. Register your provider before EzEconomy loads:
   ```java
   EzEconomy.registerStorageProvider(new YourProvider(...));
   ```
3. Only one provider can be registered. If set, EzEconomy will use it instead of YML/MySQL.
4. See the JavaDoc in `StorageProvider.java` for required methods.

This allows you to use SQLite, MongoDB, Redis, or any other system for player balances and banks.
